IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE THIS RUN THROUGH TO FIND WHICH ONES STILL EXIST AND ADDED TO ISSUES TRACKER

TODO: Can also extend dividetexturesize to LoadObject command (characters!)

TODO: There is a faster way to create smaller textures, load in DDS fast then copy MIPMAP levels lower than high one to make a smaller one!!

hi there ive downloaded the public preview of the dx11 version and tested my previous levels and everything was working fine untill i added a bit more detail and saved in the public preview now the ai that was working on the floor zones have stopped working other ai that is on the floor works fine but that can randomly stop working as well.But the ai that uses floor zones dont patrol and move the ai shoots but just stands there thought id let you know as i know this is not a final release

Granada's wife : Make It Better :)
==================================
It happens no matter what. Testing on other pcs with fresh installs. Same thing. Make a map. Put a trigger that spawns in a zombie. Place a gun. Walk to the trigger after getting the gun. Shoot the zombie. No blood spurts will come from that zombie. Now delete the trigger and the zombie and place another zombie. Test. Blood.

ZOMBIESSTOPMOVING : Here's the requested test map. The map contains only stock media, so everybody should be able to play it. Follow the main route (left, left) kill the zombies, if you can... after a while they will stop moving. The map contains a lot of trees and barrels and zombies.

WIZARDOFID (remove Morning Mountain Stroll): I kindly request that this game be removed, I didn't authorize Morning Mountain Stroll to be uploaded, I am the author of this game, thanks.

While I am also the author of the default maps below they are TGC sanctioned which were still uploaded without permission so up to the OP whether he wants to remove them or not.My only issue is with morning mountain stroll, as I still retain the copyright and original author of this map.  Area 52[contest.gamedevfort.com] This is the reason why I prefer such content not be advertised or uploaded, without direction permission to do so.TGC has been made aware of maps being build and uploaded without permission, the reply was "oh well, you can't expect us police the internet", while fair comment the reluctance to do any thing, doesn't sit well especially if you are the original author, and work has been plagiarized openly in a contest none the less.

Add "matvolume" field to the materialdefault.txt file to control the sound volume of footfalls

PCKILLER: Change AI_WANDERER:

--wonderer code
    if GetTimer(e)>4000 then
    tempangle = math.random(6.28)
    tempx = g_Entity[e]['x']+(math.cos(tempangle)*200);
    tempz = g_Entity[e]['z']+(math.sin(tempangle)*200);
    AIEntityGoToPosition(EntObjNo,tempx,tempz)
    StartTimer(e) 
    end

MARTIN: Good point about all the existing content out there!  In the next build I'll add new SETUP properties to make the new EBE grid offset -50x-50 so it lines up with your content.  Users who want it to work like the last two updates can simply change the properties if their current project depends on the old way.  Thanks for the heads up!

When "session restarts", mouse and some keys no longer work - why is this?

i want to Disable LODs completly becouse its messing with the lightmaper the lightmaper takes in consideration all the LOD models a the resolts is a mesk (Most of the times)like shadowy artifacts here an there and stuff.
take a look at my test level below check the LOD of the cube-sphere and bake with atleast one statick light in the scene you will see the shadow outline from the sphere baked to the cube. FILE: LOG_PROBLEM.ZIP

AI: Put back AI obstacle generation from terrain heights and fix why Escape produced BAD obstacle data

I've done a clean install but the axis point was still visible, however i found out that the axis point is visible in testmode when isebe is set to 'isebe =0' in the FPE file.
Change it back to 'isebe =1' and the axispoint is not visible anymore.

He means remove it completely, so we can create space games with gravity off and move the player and entities in any direction without hitting invisible terrain.

endcollision     = 2  -- lee new idea, convert all ragdoll to dynamic squashed sphere (enemy and plr can walk smoothly over corpse)
AND CHANGE ENDCOLLISION ENTITIY PROPERTIES FROM YES/NO TO: 0-NONE, 1-RAGDOLL, 2-BUMP

START LOWER DOWN so adding characters can be seen in good size, not little dots!!

USER: once i selected a character that i have made in gg , and placed it on the map its fine, the moment that i change the default script witch is the ai _soldier script to any other script and press apply, when if i move the character with the mouse in the editor then , also the hair and the mustache stays behind, but as long as i leave the original scrip when i place the character down, witch is ai_soldier, then it does not do it, but as soon as i change the script to any other then it happens.


USER: You can see the one time only effect if you add say block = 1,35 to the hatchet gunspec (this isn't a block animation, it's the select one, but illustrates that RMB fires the 'block' animation only once).
Quote: "24. A reworked blocking/parrying system is needed. This is mostly critical for fantasy and brawler type genres but usable in modern genres as well. The GG implementation of old Airmod simpleblock code is not currently very broken (you can initiate a block but only once and necessitates rebooting GG to block again). I advise removing the code for it as it was initially designed only for single player use against only enemies and without the presence of allies (as it predated Dark AI integration). It should be reworked from the ground up and possibly be made to emulate the compound blocking feature from the Project Blue Classic Mod which allowed a blocking manoeuvre to be sustained and deflect incoming raycast attacks within a specified angle. The system, designed and coded by Plystire, included support for blockstart, blockidle and blockend animations as well as additional animations for block reactions when struck during blockidle. Unlike Airmod's simpleblock system, it was not reliant on complementary blocking check prerequisites in enemy scripts. It simply blocked incoming raycast attacks as one would expect such a feature to work. Ideally, a damage soak value should be added to any blocking mechanic in GG. Basically set a blockdamage=x amount in gunspec and incoming, blocked damage would be checked against the blockdamage value. Any damage over the value would then be deducted from player health. "

USER: yes a properties panel or tab to change animation frames of the existing ones that are hard coded.
well the ones we can use anyway. walk strafe run jump shoot ect. just a simple way to edit in the editor.
live tab . with a view animations script like the one already included in the scrips. just a simple edit fpe
lua tab to add frame numbers to, name of entity ect.

USER: AddForce , SetVelocity, SetRotationSpeed, Raycast, Move, Rotate. Where are all physics joints ? (why not spring and cloth physics). Also you can't change physics shape at run time.

ROLFY WIN: primarily alt texture for damage, hit decals just don't go far enough and add EFFECT change back in entity properties

Increase seamless border (perhaps 1020x1020) to solve seams showing at distance (with mipmapping)

NOTE: That is definitely a bug in the Character Creator, the head model (which is separate from the body model) is not geometrically capped so you get to see through the neck on some angles.  I will see if I can adjust the ragdoll system so the neck cannot expose this absent geometry (rather than adding extra polygons to every head).

GOOD NAVMESH CREATION: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=212&v=32h-b203URk

@Lee any chance while you're at it, we could have a Lua command or some kind of flag to turn off their fear of water. In the stand alone I posted a little while back I have a scene in a sewer with shallow ankle deep water. The AI act like there is alligators in the water and avoid it. So please if we could disable their fear of water would be sensational.
With the water sounds from the AI feet in the water .

A.I TASKS:
Dive from side to side, avoid being hit again when struck
Shoot from open windows
Open and close doors
Flank Attack when two characters close enough to signal each other
Give any AI any weapon
USER: I get npc characters stuck on terrain slopes, behind group of rocks , behind some wall angle, can't walk on stairs or bridge, the AI is very cluncky and very dumb and outdated, too limited

GRAVITY
I see in the global.lua file that there syntex is this:
function GravityOff(e)
SendMessageI("setnogravity",e,1);
function GravityOn(e)
SendMessageI("setnogravity",e,0);
Ensure this works - objects suspend in thin air.

LUA
===

LUAJit - x64 faster
Zerobrane IDE - debugging, in-IDE coding
Modular - Users can write additional LUA commands
LUA GG API - Access to object, images and sprite resources

SPEED
=====

STAB: Yes, according to the Bullet documentation and my own tests the bvhStaticTriangleMesh shape is
faster. The bvhStaticTriangleMesh collision shape is designed for static objects only and does not get
a mass calculation like dynamic objects. In my opinion you should be using it for all static objects.
Also according to the Bullet documentation and Erwin Coumans ( author of Bullet ) convex hulls are faster
then the primitives for dynamic objects. I believe that this is where Bullet differs for other physics engines.
Also if you were to use six box collision shapes together for one object it would be best to combine them into a
compound collision shape as this is faster whether it is static or dynamic. You can email me if you need further info.

BITS
====

NOTE: I like the idea of a few LUA commands that can send values directly to the shader, but per-entity shader changes are tricky things and 'would' hit performance slightly if you are willing to take that hit. How many and what type of variables are you thinking about? The easiest would be a single FLOAT4 constant (gives you four floats to play with) which can be encoded with each entity and the common shader (i.e. entity_basic.fx) would be given the unique entity float4 constant, which the LUA (and perhaps entity properties) can change both at level creation time and during the game. Something like this?  Exactly like that . I've already hacked this type of thing using the fog settings and can get some cool effects going (e.g can use the spare AO texture as an alt texture on damage). Could also be used for what the OP asking highlighting the entity with a glow when being looked at etc. But of course using the fog settings for this means fog then tricky to control so I just did it as a proof of concept EDIT might be pushing luck a bit but if a float could be pushed to post process shaders too then some nice dynamic effects could happen here when player health low or coming out of water, dizzy etc. Hacked this too using the vignette radius lua to post shader and it works but would be great with a variable purely for user use 

NOTE: New Level has crap green terrain. By default should have grass, features, rocks, etc, and let user choose to start with BLANK one
NOTE: Add ALL REQUIRED REDIST Files to Save Standalone process (DX,VCREDIST)
NOTE: Add grab screen (without weapon HUD) and store as image file
NOTE: It would be fantastic to be able to get any character as a third person
NOTE: Get latest fixed Medieval weapons for core product
NOTE: Found a way to use ASSIMP for FBX to X export, then load into GG as an X (just need to fix animation skinning!!)
NOTE: I have decided on a new approach to FBX and make use of AssImp which has much better FBX import features that mine. Will be in V1.14 :)
NOTE FO V1.14: enable a way to allow us to add our own projectiletypes into guru. guru can only read fireball,handgrenade and rpggrenade form the weapon system

NOTE: Custom fonts not work:
function font_main(e)
    SetFont("Outline72",1)
    Prompt("just a test")
end
NOTE: Group select, EXTRACT/COPY and GROUP PASTE DOWN - simple but VERY desirable and shows editor progress

NOTE: Glenn Anim Issues:
I decided to do a quick script to view animations on objects, inspired by your livestream. I noticed you didn't elaborate on this particular part. I have some code working, letting you move forwards and backwards through the animation and also to pause it. I've also added a time value to slow and speed up the animation. I expected this to be fairly easy and straight forward - I was wrong!
It has issues. Running it at a slow speed seems to have a similar issue to the rotation one I mentioned with my boat script (juddering). Also, I set an animation frame max value, but it seems to totally ignore it beyond 3000 or so. It works fine with a value definitely below the anim max but go above and it caps out at around 3000 every time. It goes above this, but then seems to decrease back to 3000 on it's own, which I have not coded and am at a loss as to how and why. This leads me to believe that something is overriding my code.
CharacterControlLimbo(e) seems to do nothing whatsoever here. Unless I force the object to a certain frame it goes into the idle anim automatically. Again this seems wrong to me, and may be one reason for bad performance down the line. If GG is always trying to run the idle anim despite being overrided then I'm sure it will impact performance.
When I go above the framemax and then set the anim to reverse, it takes a while to actually register. I'm guessing this is down to the frame count increasing but the actual frame shown being limited to a max value (in the FPE probably). Is there an easy way to grab the max frames of an object in lua to avoid this possibly?
At certain speeds (slow) when paused the anim seems to flick between frames. I set the frame to the current one, so this should never happen.
I include the script I've made for your perusal. I used the standard combat soldier model, so adding this script to that is all you need to test it. All keys used are listed when run.
Here's hoping you find a solution and hopefully improve performance as well :) When objects animate without any code at all there's something wrong!

JUAN Must Have List
-Be able to deactivate the red injury indicator in hurt zones.
-Be able to change the starting health using scripts. Its not adjustable in lua.
-Be able to change the player speed using scripts.
-Retain the reloadqty option with endless ammunition weapons. 
-Particle system.
-Be able to create your own proyectiles and explosions.
-Be able to use cubemaps in static/dinamics entities. It is extremely well suited for metal materials.
-Game Menu completely configurable. 

STEAM REVIEW:

Cons
- No particle system
- Limited Physics, no joints, no raycast, no physic Api
- Graphics are a bit outdated until you choose to go simple or stylized
- Performance can drop a lot pushing better settings and post effects
- Lightmapper is pretty outdated if you need better lightmaps
- It only supports DDS textures and it doesn't have any DDS converter to make it easy
- TPS is only usable with Wizard character and not very customisable
- Collision editor need some work to become more clear and easy to use
- Too much things are hard coded this is not great for people that want to customize
- To use your own animations and models it can become complicated to change them
- Not enought flexible to make any game genre 
- Many things should be adjusted in some editor panels instead of editing FPE files manually
- Api is very limited, lot of things are missing like camera or physics
